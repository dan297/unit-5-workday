# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## What this project does

Users will have the abiliy to enter day to day tasks and resposabilities. The workday scheduler inludes the times of the day as well as a save button that allows users to save what they have entered.
Upon refreshing the page, the users input will still be displayed due to local storageused on the JavaScript.

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.
